# Drews CPSC 120L Portfolio

Hello my name is Drew Wilkins I am an electrical Engineering major that has to take this class as part of my major. This was a fun and amzing class that i really enjoyed.

## Lab 4 - Part One

Lab 4 was one of my favirote labs because of the code that we made. I realy liked useing doubles. And it was baically the first lab that we start to use them. And later on we start use them more throughout the labs and this was baically the starting point. Addtionally, i really liked the conecept of using millmeters and ounces in the code to try to find the volume. All and all, a really good lab and a really good lab partner that helped a lot. 

## Lab 11 - Part One 

Lab 11 was also another lab that i really liked although my partner did not talk that much thus it was not the funnest of labs it was really a great lab. For instance, one of the main things that i liked about it was making loops. Although loops to me atleast are a really hard concept and i dont believe i was taught it that well once i got the hang of it they started to get easier and funner to make.Also finding out or making functions to determine what the caliores, and price of the pizza was really intersting.

## Lab 9 - Part One

Although this is my last lab that i believe had a huge impact on how much i liked this class it is not at all the worst one and is one really enjoyed doing. First off although both me and my partner did not know what we were doing when we got the hang of it the lab was really interesting.I really enjoyed that it was sports related and how it was judges that had score cards and gave scores. And how we had to make command lines through out the code and turn them into a string that could give the avg score. All and all, one of my faviorte labs because of the complex and uses of loops and strings. 

## Conclduing 

All and all, the labs and new friends that i made throughout this semsester was really fun. And cant wait to make more connction in the later class.
